Through the course of the year — and especially during Annual Enrollment — we find ourselves being asked questions about Pennsylvania’s drug assistance programs: PACE and PACENET.

[Sample PACE card]

## PACE and PACENET
If you’re not familiar with PACE and PACENET, they are programs that help eligible Pennsylvania residents pay prescription drug costs. These programs are specific to the state of Pennsylvania. Medicare’s Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly is separate and distinct from Pennsylvania’s PACE.

Here are 5 helpful items to keep in mind regarding PACE and PACENET:

### Lost PACE Card
To request assistance obtaining a new card, contact PACE Cardholder Services at 1-800-225-7223.

### Show Your PACE Card
When you visit a participating pharmacy to have prescriptions filled, be sure to show your PACE or PACENET card. For PACE plus Medicare prescription drug coverage, it’s a good idea to bring both cards.

### Does PACE Cover Flu Shots?
Good question…but what’s usually more relevant is that Medicare covers a flu shot. The PACE formulary changes over time so check with your pharmacy or call PACE/PACENET at 1-800-225-7223.

### Never Pay a Fee to Join
There is no such thing as a “PACE application fee”. Beware of anyone who tries to tell you differently. PA’s Attorney General wrote a great article to help consumers avoid fraud related to programs like PACE. It’s from a few years ago but most points are still relevant today.

### Helpful PACE Websites
Some of our most visited websites related to PACE and PACENET are:

* Pennsylvania State Senator Fumo’s PACE page.
* The PACEcares website.
* Pennsylvania Department of Aging’s PACE and Affordable Medications page.


In closing, if you or someone you love is a Pennsylvania resident and has questions about PACE, don’t be afraid to ask for assistance from the PA Department of Aging at 1-800-225-7223 or online at www.aging.state.pa.us.
